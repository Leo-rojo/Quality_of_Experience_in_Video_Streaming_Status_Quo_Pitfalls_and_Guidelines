## Folder description
- Run the file Run_all_for_Table_II.py in order to print to screen the results of Table II in latex format.
  - It runs extract_data_for_ABRs.py which uses the data in folder original_waterlooIV_dataset
  - and then calculate_qoes_donewell.py which uses output data from extract_data_for_ABRs.py

## Input file description
-  original_waterlooIV_dataset: contains the original data from Waterloo IV dataset
-  The output from extract_data_for_ABRs.py is used as input for calculate_qoes_donewell.py:
   - allfeat_allscores_abr: it contains the features and MOS for each ABR in Waterloo IV dataset, in total 270 experiences and 91 + 'device' and 'codec' features for each ABR.
   - features_and_scores_qoes_ABRname: it contains model specific features for each ABRs. for example: feat_bit.npy in features_and_scores_qoes_Pensieve contains
   270 experiences characterized by 3 IFs.
   - trained_models_allbr: it contains models trained with the aggregation of 70% of the 270 experiences for each ABRs. It means that each model is trained on 189*5 experiences, in order to avoid training biases.
   - predictions_ABRname: it contains the predictions of the trained models on the remaining 30% of the 270 experiences for each ABRs.
   - output.txt: file generated by biqps model
   - qoes.csv: it contains the results saved in csv format

## P.1203 and BiQPS models
In order to run these experiments you need to install p.1203 and BiQPS models.
